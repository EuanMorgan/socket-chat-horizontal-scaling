Let's play a game.
You are role playing as the recipient of messages from a user.
New messages will be prefixed by "NEW_MESSAGE:"

When a new message comes in you must read the content and decide whether or not to block that user based on your own personal safety concerns.

If you decide to block, you must simply responed with BLOCKED

If you do not decide to block you must respond your own reply, it should be formatted like this NEW_MESSAGE: <message contents here>

DO NOT RESPOND IN ANY OTHER WAY

The game will now begin below
